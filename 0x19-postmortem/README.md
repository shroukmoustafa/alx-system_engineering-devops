Isse Summary:

Duration: Start Time: April 10, 2024, 13:00 UTC End Time: April 11, 2024, 02:00 UTC Impact: The service outage affected 75% of users, resulting in slow response times and intermittent errors. Root Cause: An unanticipated surge in traffic overwhelmed the database servers, causing a cascade failure in the backend. Timeline:

April 10, 2024

13:00 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server load. Actions taken: Investigated database servers for performance issues, suspected database query inefficiencies. Assumptions made: Initially thought to be a database bottleneck due to inefficient queries. Escalated the incident to the backend engineering team. April 10, 2024

16:00 UTC: Further investigation revealed no significant database query issues. Actions taken: Explored network congestion as a potential cause, checked load balancer configurations. Misleading path: Focus on network congestion without considering frontend server capacity. Escalated the incident to the network operations team. April 10, 2024

19:00 UTC: Network team confirmed no issues with network infrastructure. Actions taken: Started examining frontend servers for performance bottlenecks. Misleading path: Ignored the possibility of external traffic spikes. Escalated the incident to the system architecture team. April 11, 2024

02:00 UTC: Root cause identified - unexpected surge in incoming traffic. Actions taken: Implemented temporary traffic throttling measures to stabilize backend services. Resolved the incident by scaling up backend infrastructure to handle increased load. Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

An unanticipated surge in traffic overwhelmed the backend servers, leading to performance degradation and intermittent errors. Resolution:

Implemented temporary traffic throttling measures to stabilize the system. Scaled up backend infrastructure to handle increased load. Optimized database queries and introduced query caching to improve overall system performance. Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Implement automatic scaling policies to dynamically adjust backend infrastructure based on traffic patterns. Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect traffic spikes and anomalies in real-time. Conduct regular load testing to ensure system scalability and resilience. Tasks:

Implement automatic scaling policies using Kubernetes or similar orchestration tools. Enhance monitoring infrastructure to include real-time traffic analytics. Conduct comprehensive load testing scenarios to simulate traffic spikes and validate system performance under stress conditions.
